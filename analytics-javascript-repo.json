All they have to do is click a button at the top right of the dashboard labeled \"user data,\" and that will reveal forms for data entry, where the user can enter in a projected number of tasks for the day, and a new section of the dashboard will automatically appear with the projected number of tasks, a data visualization, and a button. The user pushes that button every time they complete a task, and progress will be displayed in real-time through the data visualization.
